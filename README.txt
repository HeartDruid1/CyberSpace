Required Packages



CyberSpace is written in Python 3 using PyGame (I used version 1.9.2 I believe but it should work with other versions) so those two things are the only required dependencies.

--------------------------------

How To Run



Once Python3 and PyGame are installed simply run the CyberSpace.py file

--------------------------------

Known Bugs and Issues

1. 

The rocket will hit the borders and not go beyond the borders unless forced through with the arrow keys

Plot/Story



You are a pilot aboard the Cyber-SpaceShip tasked with reaching record breaking Internet Speeds.

This is a task that only the bravest of Internet Surfers can achieve. 
While cruising at super high
speeds you must dodge clusters of data that are conveniently marked as 3 1/2 Inch Floppy Disks and Emails which
 are marked as regular snail mail.

--------------------------------

Controls



Use the left and right arrow keys to move from side to side avoiding the oncoming obstacles.
